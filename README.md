# Kaggle Plant Seedlings Classification

Our model for competing in [this Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-seedlings-classification).
This is for the MIDS w207 (Applied Machine Learning) final project. 

See [the Jupyter Notebook](./acarl005/mids-w207-final/blob/master/main.ipynb).


### Setup

1. Download the necessary Python packages.
1. Download the data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-seedlings-classification/data), unzip it, and place in `./data/train/raw` and `./data/test/raw`. It should look something like `./data/train/raw/<class-name>/*.png` and `./data/test/raw/*.png`. The training data is organized into subdirectories, named after their respective classes. The test data should have no subdirectories, as it is unlabelled.
